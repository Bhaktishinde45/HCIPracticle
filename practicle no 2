ChatGPT said:
Sure! To implement GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) modeling technique, I’ll first explain what GOMS is, then apply it to a specific user behavior scenario.

What is GOMS?
Goals: What the user wants to achieve.

Operators: Basic actions the user performs (click, type, move mouse, etc.)

Methods: Procedures or sequences of operators to accomplish goals.

Selection Rules: How the user decides which method to use if there are multiple ways.

Scenario Example:
User wants to register for an online course on an educational website.

Step 1: Define the Goal
Main Goal: Register for an online course.

Step 2: Identify Operators
O1: Move mouse cursor

O2: Click mouse button

O3: Type text on keyboard

O4: Scroll page

O5: Press Enter key

Step 3: Define Methods for the goal "Register for an online course"
Method 1: Register using "Sign Up" button on homepage
Move mouse to "Sign Up" button (O1)

Click "Sign Up" button (O2)

Type registration info (name, email, password) (O3)

Click "Submit" button (O1 + O2)

Select course from course list (O1 + O2)

Click "Enroll" button (O1 + O2)

Method 2: Register via course page
Move mouse to "Courses" menu (O1)

Click "Courses" menu (O2)

Scroll to desired course (O4)

Click on course name (O1 + O2)

Click "Register" button (O1 + O2)

Fill registration form (O3)

Click "Submit" (O1 + O2)

Step 4: Selection Rules
If user wants to browse all courses first, use Method 2.

If user knows the course and wants to quickly sign up, use Method 1.

Summary GOMS Model for User Registering:
Component	Details
Goal	Register for an online course
Operators	O1: Move mouse cursor, O2: Click mouse, O3: Type text, O4: Scroll, O5: Press Enter
Methods	Method 1: Sign Up from homepage → fill form → select course → enroll
Method 2: Browse courses → select course → register → fill form → submit
Selection	If user knows course → Method 1; if wants to browse → Method 2
