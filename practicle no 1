Sure! Here are five technologies featured in the Knowledge Navigator video (a visionary Apple concept from 1987) that were not around in 1987 but are widespread today:

Touchscreen Tablets — The video shows a tablet-like device with a touchscreen interface, which wasn’t commercially available in 1987 but is now common (iPads, Android tablets).

Voice-Activated Personal Assistants — The video features a digital assistant responding to voice commands, similar to today’s Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant.

Video Conferencing — Real-time video calls shown in the video were futuristic then, but now are routine via Zoom, Teams, FaceTime, etc.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) — The assistant understands and responds in conversational natural language, a complex AI feature not practical in 1987 but widespread today.

Hyperlinked Multimedia Documents — The idea of seamless navigation between documents, videos, and images with hyperlinks resembles today’s web and multimedia apps, which weren’t available back then.
